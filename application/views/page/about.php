<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Learning for me is always a very exciting venture.I believe that knowledge gained is something no one can take away from me once it is acquired.   In reviewing the course package at BrainStation, I was most excited to see the focus on iOS development.  IOS development is my main passion and I would like to acquire as many new skills through the program.  I spoke in depth about the course components with one of the learning advisors, Mr. Mitch.</p>
<p>I also gave him a good idea about my programming experience and we spoke about Object Oriented Programming.  He encouraged me to apply to the program and agreed that I would benefit greatly from the courses available. Another aspect of BrainStation’s course design that excited me was the interactive live classes.  It’s always valuable to be able to get direct feedback and ask questions as they arise.  It is also imperative to get direct consultation from professionals in the industry that</p>
<p>can share real world proficiency. Overall, I really enjoy the way the entire program is constructed and the benefits I will reap after its completion.</p>
